	In 1956, the West German Government offered technical assistance for establishing an institute of higher education in engineering
	in India. The first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West Germany in 1959 for the establishment of the Indian Institute 
	of Technology at Madras. IIT Madras was started with technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of West Germany
	and was at the time the largest international educational project sponsored by the West German government. The Government of the
	Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide the following assistance in the establishment of a higher technological institute
	at Madras:This has led to several collaborative research efforts with universities and institutions in Germany over the years.
	Although official support from the German government has ended, several research efforts involving the DAAD programme and Humboldt 
	Fellowships still exist.

	Internationally, IIT Madras was ranked 250 in the QS World University Rankings of 2023 and 53 in Asia.
    It was ranked 701–800 in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities of 2022.IIT Madras 
	also ranked 1ST among engineering colleges by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2022[38] 
	and first overall.IIT Madras BS in Data Science won Silver in the Wharton (University of Pennsylvania) - QS
	Reimagine Education Awards.The Indian Institutes of Technology are under control of the Government of India and 
	therefore have strict rules for grading. Depending on the course the evaluation is based on participation in class, 
	attendance, quizzes, exams and/or papers. Continuous evaluation is done by course instructors. The Evaluation System of IIT Madras
	which is also used in other IITs is the Cumulative Grade Point Average with a scale from 0 to 10 which is converted to letters:
	CGPA then gets calculated as the cumulative credit-weighted average of the grade points: CGPA = (Σ Ci • GPi) / (Σ Ci) where: N 
	is the number of courses Ci is credits for the ith course GPi is grade points for the ith course CGPA is the cumulative grade 
	point average.The CGPA is not the same as the one commonly used in the United States. In India some credits might be awarded 
	during Bachelor studies for Co-curricular and Extra-curricular Activities, while during the Master Programme this is not allowed.
	Through agreements with numerous international organisations, IIT grades are accepted from many international organisations like NTU,
	NUS and DAAD.Additionally, the attendance of the students is evaluated with VG for very good (always present), G for good 
	(not present every lecture) and P for poor (student was present less than 85% of lectures).
