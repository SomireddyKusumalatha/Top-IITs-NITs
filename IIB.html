	<td>The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) is a public research university and technical institute
	in Powai, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. IIT Bombay is ranked among the most prestigious academic institutions in India, 
	and has consistently been the most preferred choice for Indian students in STEM fields such as Computer Science.
    IIT Bombay was founded in 1958.In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance.A committee 
	formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction
	for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning began in 1957 and the first batch of 100 students
	was admitted in 1958.Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has physically expanded to include more than 584 major
	buildings with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers.IIT Bombay is considered as one of the foremost engineering 
	and science universities in Asia, and as the most reputed and the most competitive institute in India to get into and has been 
	the first-preferred destination of top rank holders in the science and engineering disciplines. It is known for its 4-year, 5-year 
	& 2-year programmes for which the entrance is through the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE), Joint Admission Test for Masters (JAM)
	and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Degrees offered in the university include the four-year Bachelor of Technology 
	(B.Tech.), the two- or three-year Master of Technology (M.Tech.), the four-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), the two-year Master 
	of Science (M.Sc.) and the five-year Inter-Disciplinary Dual-Degree Programme (IDDDP) among many others. It also has a comprehensive
	graduate program offering doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.It currently has a total of 15 academic 
	departments, 20 additional education centres, a school of excellence and four interdisciplinary programmes including a management
	programme and industrial design programmes.</td></tr>

	<h1>History</h1>
	</div>
	<table>
	<tr><td>IIT Bombay was the second Indian Institute of Technology to be established in 1958 with assistance from UNESCO
	and with funds contributed by the Soviet Union.[citation needed] UNESCO agreed to provide equipment and technical experts 
	mainly from the Soviet Union, while the Government of India accepted the responsibility for all other expenses including 
	the cost of the building project and recurring expenses. The site chosen for the institute was Powai with an area of 550 
	acres (2.2 km2) which was given by the then Bombay State Government. While construction was being completed, the first academic
	session of the Institute opened on 25 July 1958, in its temporary home at the Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association 
	(SASMIRA) building in Worli with 100 students.[citation needed] The following is the present position regarding the assistance 
	received from UNESCO under the UN Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance.These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants
	for admission to the first year undergraduate engineering programmes of Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering 
	Physics, Energy, Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering, and MSc Chemistry. One of the main objectives of establishing the institute
	was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialized engineering and technological sciences. The need for establishing 
	adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years. While the institute was
	functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and
	Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10 March 1959.[citation needed]
    On July 9, 2018, IIT Bombay was conferred the status of Institute of Eminence by the Ministry of Human Resources & Development, 
	along with 5 other institutes in India which would provide it additional autonomy and government funds

	<tr><td>The IIT Bombay campus, having an area of about 545 acres, is located at Powai, in East Mumbai, between the Vihar and Powai 
	lakes. The campus is divided into clusters of buildings. The academic area chiefly comprises the main building, various departmental
	annexes and auditoria. All department annexes are connected by a corridor named Infinite Corridor. Beyond the Convocation Hall lie 
	most of the hostels. There are a total of 18 hostels, of which two hostels (Hostels 10 and 11) and a wing of the newly constructed
	hostel (Hostel 15) are for female students.Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green
	cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also
	led to occasional sightings of leopards and mugger crocodiles along the banks of the Powai lake. Sometimes they stray into the campus in search of prey.
    The campus has also recorded over 200 species of birds including Indian grey hornbill, Indian pitta, Vigors's sunbird, Ashy prinia, 
	Indian paradise flycatcher, Rufous woodpecker, Oriental darter.The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds; 
	and tennis, basketball, squash and volleyball courts. It also has a Students' Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other extracurricular activities.
	In addition to these facilities, the campus also houses two high schools, one of which is a Kendriya Vidyalaya and the other is called IIT Campus School.
