	College Tiruchirappalli in 1964 by the governments of India and Tamil Nadu under the affiliation of the University 
	of Madras. The college was granted deemed university status in 2003 with the approval of the University Grants Commission
	(UGC), the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and the Government of India and renamed the National Institute 
	of Technology Tiruchirappalli.NIT Trichy is recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India under

	of NITSER.[5] The institute is funded by the Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India; and focuses exclusively on 
	engineering, management, science, technology, and architecture.[4][3] The institute offers10 bachelor's, 42 master's, and 17 doctoral programmes through its 17 academic departments and awards more than 1900 degrees annually.

	<table>
	<tr><td>
	Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who was the prime minister of India from 1947 to 1964,[21] wanted India to become a world leader 
	in science and technology. Under his administration, the central government started fourteen regional engineering colleges
	(RECs) between 1959 and 1965 at several cities in India. The REC at Tiruchirappalli was established in 1964 under the 
	affiliation of the University of Madras, as a co-operative venture between the Government of India and the Government of Tamil Nadu.
	The founder of the college was Prof. P.S. Manisundaram, a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of Loyola College,
	Chennai and the Technical University of Nova Scotia (now part of Dalhousie University), Canada. He served as the principal of REC 
	Tiruchirappalli from its formation in 1964 to 1982.In the early 1980s, the state government began to find the logistics of controlling 
	these colleges from Madras to be tedious and split the aegis into the Bharathidasan and Bharathiar universities for the Tiruchirappalli
	and Coimbatore areas, respectively. In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the Bharathidasan University umbrella, of which 
	Dr. P.S. Manisundaram served as the inaugural vice-chancellor. The institute would grant degrees under this name for the 
	next 20 years, except for a brief stint under Anna University in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under Bharathidasan University.
